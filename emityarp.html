              >Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light What so proudly we
              hailed at the twilight's last gleaming? Whose broad stripes and
              bright stars through the perilous fight, O'er the ramparts we
              watched were so gallantly streaming? And the rocket's red glare,
              the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof through the night that our
              flag was still there. Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet
              wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave? On the
              shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep, Where the foe's
              haughty host in dread silence reposes, What is that which the
              breeze, o'er the towering steep, As it fitfully blows, half
              conceals, half discloses? Now it catches the gleam of the
              morning's first beam, In full glory reflected now shines in the
              stream: 'Tis the star-spangled banner! Oh long may it wave O'er
              the land of the free and the home of the brave! And where is that
              band who so vauntingly swore That the havoc of war and the
              battle's confusion, A home and a country should leave us no more!
              Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps' pollution. No
              refuge could save the hireling and slave From the terror of
              flight, or the gloom of the grave: And the star-spangled banner in
              triumph doth wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the
              brave! Oh! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand Between their
              loved home and the war's desolation! Blest with victory and peace,
              may the heav'n rescued land Praise the Power that hath made and
              preserved us a nation. Then conquer we must, when our cause it is
              just, And this be our motto: "In God is our trust." And the
              star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave O'er the land of the
              free and the home of the brave!

              When he nothing shines upon Then you show your little light
